	 about: " <h4>Welcome to IntacTooth app</h4><p>IntacTooth app  will help you keep your teeth and gums healthy.<br /> This is done in two ways:<br /> 1. by teaching you about dental caries, gum disease and ways of preventing it, and<br />2. by enabling you to track your own behavior related to caries and gum disease prevention.  This will help you become more aware of your habits.<br />Eventually you will incorporate new knowledge and habits and this app will no longer be necessary. </p><p>App can be used with or without participation of your dentist.<br />If you are using it by yourself it will show you how to maintain oral hygiene and good dietary habits, which is certainly important. But only dentist can determine your caries risk level, treat current caries lesions and prescribe additional therapy.<br />Whether you use this app or not it is necessary that you regularly visit your dentist. It may be more or less difficult depending on your own current habits and other factors (accessibility of dental service in your country, costs etc), but there is no adequate caries treatment and prevention without regular visits to dentist.<br />",
	 
	 disease: "<h4>DENTAL CARIES AND GUM DISEASE</h4><p>Both these diseases are complex with multifactorial etiology. Explaining it all is out of the scope of this short info, but you are strongly encouraged to use resources we provided to learn more.<br />These are the things you should take care of in order to keep your teeth and gums healthy:<br />1. Eating habits<br />Frequency of eating sugar containing food is single most important factor related to dental caries. This is food containing sucrose, glucose, fructose and cooked starch. Note that frequency of taking this food is what is important - not the amount (most dangerous is eating candies or drinking sweet beverages during large part of day). The bottom line is - reduce frequency of eating sweets as much as possible and rinse your mouth with water after eating it.<br />2. Oral hygiene<br />Brush your teeth twice a day - after breakfast and before bedtime. Brushing should last at least 2 minutes. Floss once daily before brushing.<br />But even if you adhere to these guidelines it will not help you much if your brushing technique is bad or if you use wrong brush or floss.  Invest some time to learn about brushing and flossing technique, it will pay off many times over. Refer to the resources we provided. Your dentist should also educate and train you how to keep good oral hygiene. This way you will remove food remnants and more importantly - dental plaque. It is biofilm formed by oral microorganisms. It is the major cause of both dental caries and gingivitis/periodontal disease. If not removed every day,  plaque matures and eventually turns into tartar which can be removed only by dental hygienist.<br />3. Regular visits to dentist<br />This is important for several reasons:<br />1. Dentist will conduct clinical examination, take X-ray and do other necessary tests. This way he will discover if you have new caries lesions, inflamed gums, periodontal pockets or any other condition that should be taken care of.<br />2. Data from these findings are necessary to calculate your overall caries risk level. Once your risk level is determined it will guide dentist how to deal with it, which therapeutics and which regimen to prescribe. Good oral hygiene and refraining from eating sweets are not enough in cases of high or extreme caries risk.<br />3. He will treat your new caries lesions and other conditions that require treatment.<br />4. There is range of very powerful in-office prophylactic measures that can be included in your caries preventive regimen (application of fluoride varnish for example). Dentist also can teach you how to brush and floss.<br />5. Your teeth should be periodically cleaned professionally. Dental hygienist will remove tartar (dental calculus) and plaque.<br />6. NEITHER MAINTAINING GOOD ORAL HYGIENE AND EATING HABITS NOR USING THIS APP IS NOT REPLACEMENT FOR REGULAR VISITS TO DENTIST. Dental caries and periodontal disease have multifactorial etiology and there are cases that quickly progress and may have serious health  consequences if not treated professionally. Also these two diseases are not only problems one might have in his mouth. There are other, sometimes very serious oral diseases (oral cancer for example) where early diagnosis is crucial for outcome. Some other systemic diseases give first symptoms in mouth which is also important to be discovered as early as possible.",
